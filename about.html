            <p><em>"It is our duty at New Reality Studio's to make a half-assed or repackaged product for dated hardware, and pressure you into preordering our products, screw waiting for reviews BUY OUR PRODUCT before it's even been concieved, you should buy it the moment it becomes an idea! Zombie Consumerism is the Future, and the Future smells like cash money!"</p>
            <br>
            <p>T.M. Osborne CEO</em></p>
            <br>
            <p>Our CEO and Mastermind T.M. Osborne, or "Max" as he calls himself was once a Programmer trained at Fidgetech where he learned to harness his autism, so he could finally become Bill Gates, and make millions. Originally he had gone in with good intentions, and wanted to make the best possible CRPG's or Program Electronics that actually help people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Max was trained to solder, among other things at an Organization called Community Workshop, where he learned about robots, electronics, 3D-Printing, and most importantly how to modify retro consoles for RGB, S-video, Overclocking, and Bypassing Region Locks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One day however he was tempted by the dark side, and given the opportunity to achieve his dreams through any horrific means possible, he would soon overpowered by Malevolence, and it would consume him, and hurt everyone around him.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Not long after graduating he sold Fidgetech out to the CIA, FBI, ATF, IRS, and NRA for sweet bribe money used to start New Reality Digital.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If he was going to make it into the Video Game Industry he would have to become a Pathological Liar, and a modern Snake Oil Salesman, he ran on "<strong>ANYTHING</strong> for 60 Dollars!" as his motto.</p>
