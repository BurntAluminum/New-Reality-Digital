# New Reality Digital

#### A humor site set in an alternate future(probably), where I run a totally corrupt Game Publishing company, inspired by Devolver Digitals E3 Press Conferences.

#### By Max Osborne

## Description

This is a fake website for a totally corrupt video game company that pushes garbage out onto shelves as quickly as possible, and makes the statement that I'm an old Grumpus
opposed to blindly buying the hot product out of Zombie Consumerism.

## Setup

To set this up access my GitHub pages.
