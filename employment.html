        <p>Our project leads were recently bailed out of jail after many notorious projects that did not deliver what they promised, we picked only the sleaziest Developers and Snake Oil Salesmen to head our Studios, nothing can go wrong, this is the game industry after all!
        <p>Our employee's are hand picked like fresh apples, from sweatshops across the world, and are paid in Monopoly money to create your favorite games, like Skram for MS-DOS and Amiga, or Peter Mollynews Tuk-Tuk-Vacation for the Commodore 64, our executives like to watch over our employees menacingly whilst throwing Dog Treats at them, try it, ITS FUN!
