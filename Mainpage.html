        <p>We publish only the hottest same games that we publish every year, as we seek to become a AAA Game Company by immitating AAA practices like repackaging the same garb- I mean quality video games that YOU LOVE.<br>
        <p>Our are made with an overpowering Corporate Greed, you know, that thing that motivates the entire world to keep spinning? GREED is key to success, we know this, Greed motivates us to get more money, pay our greedy employee's, and most importantly pay our greedy executives third mortgage on their second vacation home. We need money to grease the wheels of this Amoral Machine so you can play Medal of Duty IIIIIIIIIIIII trust us it's the same game you know and love a thirteenth time.<br>
        <p>Our work is a labor of Malevolent Greed, and a towering middle finger to the consumer, because we think you are all goldfish.
